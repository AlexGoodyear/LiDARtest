# LiDARtest
This is a quick confidence check for a Delta-2G LiDAR module that I obtained from AliExpress.

It is supplied as a replacement robot vacuum part and comes without any documentation. There are a couple of photos on the AliExpress webpage but not enough information to use the LiDAR in a hobby project. [Not Black Magic](https://notblackmagic.com/bitsnpieces/lidar-modules/) published an extremely useful LiDAR introduction and teardown of this unit [complete with some code](https://github.com/NotBlackMagic/Delta-2G-LiDAR-Driver) to access the device data stream. I back ported the Python 3.10+ module to be compatible with earlier Python 3 versions and added the graphical output below.

# Sample output

Use the "Scale" to alter the radius of the map measured in metres. Press the "Exit" button to quit the test.

# 3D printed support/mount

I designed a support mount (LiDARmount.stl) that is Meccano compatible.

The original order said it would take 4 to 5 weeks but it arrived in a week.
